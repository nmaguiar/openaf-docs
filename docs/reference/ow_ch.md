   - compact (Boolean) Upon channel create/destroy it will try to run a compact operation over the file to save space.
   - map (String/Function) The map name (defaults to 'default'). If defined as a function it will receive the key as argument if possible (only for get/set/unset/setall) for sharding proposes.

The map will be created if it doesn't exist. Operations getKeys/getAll can be paginated with the extra map argument containing start and end

This OpenAF implementation establishes a proxy to another channel. The creation options are:

   - chTarget  (String)   The channel that will receive all operations (if proxyFunc doesn't return).
   - proxyFunc (Function) Function that receives a map (by reference that can be changed) with: op (operation), name (target channel), function (where applicable), full (where applicable), match (the match of getSet), k (the key(s)), v (the value(s)) and timestamp. If this function returns something no operation will be executed on the chTarget and the value returned by the function will be the value returned by this channel.
