### ow.net.doh

__ow.net.doh(aAddr, aType, aProvider, aCache, aCacheTimeout) : String__

````
Performs a DNS over HTTPs query with aAddr. Optionally you can provide the aType of record (defaults to 'a') and the DNS over HTTPs aProvider between 'google', 'cloudflare', 'nextdns' and 'local' (that doesn't use DoH but fallbacks to  Java's DNS resolver).
